# DropBox Clone :mortar_board: |  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/k-schaeffer/dropbox-clone-js) [![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]][linkedin-url] 


This is a project developed so I can improve my programming Skills in JavaScript.
<br>
The purpose of the project is to focus in the JS programming, and to not bother about the HTML/CSS i've used a dropbox clone template. 
<br>
**IMPORTANT:** I did it following a Udemy course and some functionalities may not be working on the best way, but, again, this is a project focused on the study of the language.
<br>
**Note**: The whole content of the course is in Brazilian Portuguese, due to that, if you find something in portuguese you already know why.

## Take a look :eyes:

## Built With :pencil:

- [X] [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript) - The focus of the project.
- [X] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The Express server was created with Express-generator, and the server by itself is a NodeJS server. 
- [X] [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com) - The database of the project is the FRD, which is free and very simple to use.
- [X] [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com) - The storage of my dropbox-clone is the Firebase Storage, which is free too.

## Note :speaker:
In this project i've seen:
- [X] A lot of JavaScript;
- [X] NodeJS;
- [X] Firebase RTD/Storage and its methods;
- [X] A lot of promises;
- [X] Promise.all;
- [X] Formidable;
- [X] Events;
- [X] Routes;
- [X] Dataset;
- [X] FormData;
- [X] Async Requests with Ajax;
- [X] DOM manipulation;

## What this DropBox-clone can do? :bookmark:
This clone can:
- [X] Upload files to cloud;
- [X] Open files from cloud;
- [X] Rename files in the cloud;
- [X] Delete files from the cloud;
- [X] Select uploaded files with ctrl or shift;
- [X] Create folders;
- [X] Navigate within folders;
- [X] Show you how much time you'll need to upload some file;
<br>

**That's all?** Yes, at least, for now! But remember, all of this was built with PURE JS.
<br>

## How can I run this project locally?  :computer:
Here we go, to get started with this project:
1. Make sure to have NodeJS installed properly (If you don't, install it following their website steps)
```
node -v
```
2. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/K-Schaeffer/dropbox-clone-js.git
```
3. Install Bower dependencies (If you don't have Bower installed, click [here](https://bower.io))
```
bower install
```
4. Install NPM dependencies
```
npm i
```
5. Use your google account to access the Firebase website and create both a Realtime Database project and a Storage one
6. Follow their docs to modify my code in order to upload your data to your database and storage, otherwise, you'll not be able to modify both of them

Once you've done all of that, just run a 
```
npm start
```
(Make sure to run it inside the App directory)

That's all :)
