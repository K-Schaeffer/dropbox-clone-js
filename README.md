This is a study oriented project developed so I can improve my  programming Skills, at the most, in JavaScript.
<br>
I did it following a Udemy course and **I DID NOT** developed the GUI nor the HTML/CSS.
<br>
**Note**: Some of the content in this repository will be written in BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE, due to the course language.

## That's what I'm speaking of :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
